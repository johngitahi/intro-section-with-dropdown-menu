## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I had to learn flexbox and how to use it for this design. Flexbox is actually very amazing and I am looking forward to using more Flexbox.
Also learnt how to manipulate the DOM with Javascript. Awesome language that one.


### Continued development

I want to focus more on mobile responsiveness for the next project I'll attempt. Looking forward to writing more Javascript too.

### Useful resources

- [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) - This helped me learn about flexbox and CSS grid. I really liked this site and will use it going forward.
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - I love how W3schools guides are so clear. I found it really resourceful while building the dropdown menu.
